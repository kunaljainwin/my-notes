Because Algorithms are designed to work on data it is important to measure performance .O(n) => Order of operations

## Types of Algorithms

### Searching Algorithms
### Sorting algorithms
### Computational Algorithms
Eg. is a Number Prime number
### Collection Algorithm

## Types of Data structures
Node, collection of data
### Stacks Last in First Out
Expression Processibg
backtracking
### Queues First in first out
Order processing
messaging

Use list for implementing stack in python but collections has deque() to implement queue
